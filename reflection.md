What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I really struggled with this assignment in general and I'm sure there are many ways that it could be cleaner and more conscise. It's been a while since I've done any coding and I haven't worked with classes before so I felt pretty unsure about what I was doing, but I ultimately think that I learned a lot from this even if I'm definitely still confused about what exactly object-oriented programming is. 

Mattea and I spent some time trying to figure out classes together and worked to understand what "self" is and how methods should work, and I think it was really helpful to have someone to talk things over with. I'd definitely recommend looking back at the onecard example from class and also just playing around with different variables and functions to see what they do. I also found it really helpful to throw in occasional print statements to make sure my variables matched what I thought they should be.
